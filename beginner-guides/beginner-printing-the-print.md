# Beginner: Printing the Print

This is the final guide in the Beginner Guides chapter. It will cover how to upload and monitor a print on the Duet Web Console. This guide assumes you have properly configured your printer with all the previous beginner guides. That means:

* You have homed your printer
* You have configured your Z-probe offset
* You have run and enabled mesh bed leveling
* You have loaded filament into the extruder

## Uploading the G-code File

First, we will have to upload the G-code file we produced in the previous guide. Connect to the Duet Web Console on the printer. Then, press the _G-code Files_ button and then press the _Upload G-code File\(s\)_ button as shown in the image above. This will open a window which will allow you to select the G-code file you sliced. _Open_ the file and wait for it to upload.

## Printing the File

Once the file is uploaded, you can click the file in order to print it. A window will pop-up confirming that you are about to print something. Click _Yes._

## Monitoring the Print

Now, the print has started. First, the printer will reach it's designated printing temperature that you set in Cura. This might take a while and the printer will not start printing until all components have reached temperature. When the print starts the Duet Web Console will shift over to the _Print Status_ tab on the Duet Web Console. This tab allows you to monitor certain settings of the print. Two of the functions on this tab are very useful: _Z Baby Stepping_ and _Speed Factor_ , these allow you to change the height of the Z and speed while printing. If you notice that a layer is not sticking, try to reduce the speed.

Your print should now be able to run to completion.
