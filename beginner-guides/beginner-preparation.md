# Beginner: Preparation

Before starting the Beginner Guides guides, please complete the following steps to ensure your printer is working properly and is connected to your local network.

1. Read the [Critical Warnings](../getting-started/critical-warnings-and-information.md) in the Getting Started chapter of the Promega. This contains useful and important information about what to do and \(more importantly\) what not to do with your Promega.
2. Follow the [Unboxing & Assembly](../getting-started/unboxing-and-assembly.md) and [Mechanical Check](../getting-started/mechanical-check.md) guides. This will make sure your printer is ready to undergo the rigorous Beginners Guide.
3. Complete the [Network Setup](../getting-started/network-setup.md) guide in order to connect your Promega to your local network.
4. Continue on to the next guide!
