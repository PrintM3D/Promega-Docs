# ABS-R Filament

Follow this step by step guide for successful printing with ABS-R.

## Material Table

|  | First Layer | Printing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bed Temperature | 75째C | 70째C |
| Nozzle Temperature | 235째C | 235째C |
| Retraction Distance | - | - |
| Retraction Speed | - | - |

## Preparation

Follow the [Preparing a Print](../advanced-setup-guides/preparing-the-print.md) guide for more help on slicing a print. Incorporate the material settings above into printing and bed temperature.

## Guide

1. Heat the bed up to ABS-R first layer temperature
2. Once the bed is hot, probe the bed with `G30` and then level the bed with `G29 S0`. Follow the [Bed Leveling & Probing](../advanced-setup-guides/bed-leveling-and-probing.md) guide if you need help.
3. Heat up the nozzle to printing temperature and load filament. Follow the [Loading and Unloading Filament](../advanced-setup-guides/loading-and-unloading-filament.md) guide. It is best to extruder about 10  mm of filament to make sure filament is flowing through correctly. Remember to clear the extruded filament with tweezers before starting the print.
4. Upload the print to the board. For more help follow the [Running a Print](../beginners-setup-guides/running-a-print.md) guide.
