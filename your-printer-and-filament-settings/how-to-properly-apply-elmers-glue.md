# How To Properly Apply Elmer's Glue

A guide on how to apply Elmer's Glue properly.



#### Let's begin.

Heat the bed to 70 C.



{% hint style="info" %}
Wait for the bed to reach temperature.
{% endhint %}

Lightly apply a THIN layer of Elmer's glue.

The lines applied showed by all consistent \(either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do Not make crazy lines.
{% endhint %}



Wait for the layer to dry.

{% hint style="info" %}
The purple tint of the glue will fade away.
{% endhint %}



Repeat: Apply another THIN layer of Elmer's glue.



You should repeat the THIN layer application until you've done 5 layers.



Thanks to _**m3rc**_ for figuring this out.
