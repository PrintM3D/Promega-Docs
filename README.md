[Submit Issue](https://github.com/PrintM3D/Promega/issues). Allows you to search for existing issues to upvote them. 

Submit a new issue if you do not find one.

### Contributing

Please feel free to add suggestions to any of the guides by creating a pull-request or issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/PrintM3D/Promega-Docs/issues). This manual is hosted in Github.com via Gitbook.com.

The main way to collaborate to the guides is to become a collaborator. But sometimes you simply want to submit a small contribution, without becoming a regular collaborator.

On GitHub, one can use the popular _Pull Request_ feature. To do so, you would clone [https://github.com/PrintM3D/Promega-Docs](https://github.com/PrintM3D/Promega-Docs), make changes on your own copy, and submit back your changes by submitting a _Pull Request_ to M3D. Then we will review the changes accordingly.
