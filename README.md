## Features

### Expandable

The Promega is expandable, meaning you can customize it to suit your needs. These are 4 possible extruder configurations.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Compound Printing" %}
The Compound nozzle is a dual mixing nozzle, which takes in two filaments and either prints one at a time or mixes them together. 

A standard Promega will come with this extruder.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Dual Printing" %}
  
The K'Tana hot end is two, independent nozzles for dual printing. 

K'Tana nozzles are seamless, long nozzles that include a thin-wall heat break to reduce energy consumption and eliminate leaks.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Quad Printing" %}
  
The Quad extruder takes in four filaments and can either print one at a time or mix for blended colors.

You can create beautiful color prints using our CMYK color-calibrated mixing filament.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="High Temp Printing" %}
Our high-temp extruder add-on allows you to extrude materials up to 350 C. 

This upgrade is ideal for printing high-temp materials such as PEEK, if you are producing small prints. 

For larger prints, you may need a more robust system upgrade. If you are interested in this, please fill out this [form](https://airtable.com/shrPYVe4EY4mXUM4e).

### **Q&A Promega Users**

[Submit Issue](https://github.com/PrintM3D/Promega/issues). Allows you to search for existing issues to upvote them. 

Submit a new issue if you do not find one.

### Contributing

Please feel free to add suggestions to any of the guides by creating a pull-request or issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/PrintM3D/Promega-Docs/issues). This manual is hosted in Github.com via Gitbook.com.

The main way to collaborate to the guides is to become a collaborator. But sometimes you simply want to submit a small contribution, without becoming a regular collaborator.

On GitHub, one can use the popular _Pull Request_ feature. To do so, you would clone [https://github.com/PrintM3D/Promega-Docs](https://github.com/PrintM3D/Promega-Docs), make changes on your own copy, and submit back your changes by submitting a _Pull Request_ to M3D. Then we will review the changes accordingly.
