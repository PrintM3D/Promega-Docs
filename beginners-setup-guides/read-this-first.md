# Read This First

Before starting the Beginner Guides guides, please complete the following steps to ensure your printer is working properly and is connected to your local network.

1. Read the [Critical Warnings](https://promega.printm3d.com/~/edit/drafts/-LOsd42LlDMsCQgG4bzO/getting-started-1/critical-warnings-and-information) in the Getting Started chapter of the Promega. This contains useful and important information about what to do and \(more importantly\) what not to do with your Promega.
2. Follow the [Unboxing & Assembly](https://promega.printm3d.com/~/edit/drafts/-LOsd42LlDMsCQgG4bzO/getting-started-1/unboxing-and-assembly) and [Mechanical Check](https://promega.printm3d.com/~/edit/drafts/-LOsd42LlDMsCQgG4bzO/getting-started-1/mechanical-check) guides. This will make sure your printer is ready to go.
3. Complete the [Network Setup](https://promega.printm3d.com/~/edit/drafts/-LOsd42LlDMsCQgG4bzO/getting-started/network-setup) guide in order to connect your Promega to your local network.
